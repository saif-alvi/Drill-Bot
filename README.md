# stunning-carnival
This project consists of a drillbot that can traverse through a grid of nxm dimensions collecting gems along the way while avoiding walls. When the drillbot has traversed through every part of the grid it will return to its initial position. This is in the file maze_drillbot.py.

Included in this repository is a maze game where the player must reach the end goal in a grid of nxm dimensions. There is also a 2 player version included where the player can play with another player or with a computer. These are in the files maze_1player.py and maze_player2.py.
